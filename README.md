Project Description:
Pong Four is a game which carries on the same layout and rules as Connect Four but with a twist. In order to choose which column the player wants to place their move, 
they have to throw a ping-pong ball into a cup which corresponds to the column. This game will engage the users in a friendly competitive manner, as well as help improve 
their hand-eye coordination. This particular setup will consist of six columns and 5 rows which are enough to properly play the game.
